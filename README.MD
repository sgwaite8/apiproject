Our "Movie Info Finder" allows the user to input a movie title.
When they input the title, the OMDb API returns the movie title, the release date and a small plot synopsis for the user.
The user is then asked if this is the movie they were looking for. If the user types in a movie that doesn't exist, they are prompted to try again.
If they reply Yes, the movie poster opens in the browser. If they reply no, they are prompted to type in a different movie.
To run it, open the terminal and run the node api.js and input the movie title, then Y/N.
